    <h2>Eye Candy</h2>

    <p>Pictured below is not just a flower, not just my nails, and not just the sky.</p>

        <p>I love photography, and I noticed there were raindrops on the petals, leaves, and stem.
       The flower was a similar pale white to the clouds—remnants of a beautiful storm—
       and I had to take a photo. I was able to capture a million beautiful things in one picture.</p>

        <p>I began doing my own gel nails in 2020 and have consistently done them since.
           Over time, I’ve explored a variety of designs, colors, shapes, and concepts. Nail art has become a
           personal form of expression and a skill I’ve refined through practice and creativity.</p>

    <div class="image-text-pair">
        <img src="../images/storm.jpg" alt="Storm">
        <p>I’ve always been intrigued by storms—the dark sky, flashes of lightning, and thunder that gives you goosebumps.
           My mom and I often sit outside and record lightning storms. The sky becomes a gallery of beauty and mystery; in this picture you can almost see a figure holding a weapon in the clouds.</p>
