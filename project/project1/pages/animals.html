  <h2>Paws</h2>
  <p>
    Below are my two puppies, regardless of the fact they are thirteen and ten years old, Brewer and Hank. Below them are two of my grandma's dogs, Raleigh and Cassidy.

        <h3>Brewer</h3>
        <p>Brewer is a Chihuahua Mix, and Hank is a Chocolate Lab, so they have an interesting dynamic.
           Brewer was gifted to me on my golden birthday when I turned 9. My parents found him on Craigslist for $300,
           and thought, "Yes, he's perfect." He isn’t potty trained, can’t play catch, and gets grumpier each year—
           and I wouldn’t trade him for anything.

        <h3>Hank</h3>
        <p>Hank is the complete opposite—he’s protective, fast, strong, plays soccer (we swear), and never causes trouble.
           Hank is the dog everyone wants and needs; we call him our therapy dog.
           A year before we got him, our Chocolate Lab Dakota passed away.
           We knew we couldn’t go on without one, and found another perfect fit in Hank.

        <h3>Rahleigh & Cassidy</h3>
        <p>These are my grandma’s dogs, Raleigh and Cassidy. They are ginormous babies.
           Rah on the left is a Great Dane, and Cass on the right is an Irish Wolfhound, that doesn't stop them from thinking and being lap dogs, though. They are so special, and they are the sweetest dogs you could ever know, they are gentle giants.
